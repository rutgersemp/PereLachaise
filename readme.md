# Pere Lachaise

Pere Lachaise is a shitpost about gaming chairs that physically manifested as a full holonomic drivetrain compatible with standard gas cylinder deskchairs.
The name is French for "Father chair", and fittingly also the name of a world famous cemetary of the same name, as this unholy machine is certain to kill someone at some point.

## Installation
Code is being developed for use on an RP2040 right now, simply install the toolchain according to [their documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/pico/getting-started/) and place these files in a folder next to the SDK.

## CAD files
CAD files and drawings will soon be added to, this thing is still a huge mess so bear with me.
